# Model Context Protocol (MCP) Research

## Overview
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic for connecting AI assistants to data sources, including content repositories, business tools, and development environments. It enables secure, two-way connections between data sources and AI-powered tools.

## Key Features
- Universal, open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources
- Replaces fragmented integrations with a single protocol
- Provides a simpler, more reliable way to give AI systems access to data
- Enables AI systems to maintain context as they move between different tools and datasets

## Architecture
- Developers can expose their data through MCP servers
- AI applications (MCP clients) can connect to these servers
- The architecture is straightforward and designed for secure, two-way connections

## Components
1. The Model Context Protocol specification and SDKs
2. Local MCP server support in Claude Desktop apps
3. Open-source repository of MCP servers

## Implementation Examples
- Pre-built MCP servers for popular enterprise systems like Google Drive, Slack, GitHub, Git, Postgres, and Puppeteer
- Early adopters include Block and Apollo
- Development tools companies including Zed, Replit, Codeium, and Sourcegraph are working with MCP

## Benefits for Fraud Detection
- Can connect AI fraud detection systems to various data sources (transaction databases, user profiles, etc.)
- Maintains context across different data sources for more comprehensive fraud analysis
- Enables secure access to sensitive financial data
- Provides a standardized way for multiple AI agents to access and share context about potential fraud cases

## Integration Potential
- Can be used to connect multi-agent systems for fraud detection
- Enables multi-modal agents to share context about transactions and user behaviors
- Provides a foundation for agent-to-agent communication in a fraud detection ecosystem
- Can integrate with Neo4j for graph-based fraud pattern detection
