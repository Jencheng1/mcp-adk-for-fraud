# Agent Development Kit (ADK) Research

## Overview
The Agent Development Kit (ADK) is a flexible and modular framework for developing and deploying AI agents. It's designed to work with popular LLMs and provides integration capabilities with various technologies, including Neo4j for graph database operations.

## Key Features
- Supports integration with Model Context Protocol (MCP) as tools
- Enables multi-agent systems development
- Provides integration with various agent frameworks
- Supports Neo4j integration for graph-based operations
- Works with Google Agent Space platform

## Integration with Neo4j
- ADK can be used with Neo4j MCP servers to access graph database capabilities
- Supports Neo4j Cypher queries for data retrieval and manipulation
- Can extract graph database schema to enable agents to generate appropriate queries
- Integrates with Google's MCP Toolbox which provides optimized tool integration for graph databases

## Integration with Other Technologies
- Complements A2A (Agent to Agent) protocol for multi-agent communication
- Works with LangGraph for agent orchestration
- Can be used with various agent frameworks like CrewAI, Pydantic.AI, and Semantic Kernel

## Benefits for Fraud Detection
- Enables development of specialized agents for different aspects of fraud detection
- Provides access to graph database capabilities for pattern recognition
- Supports multi-agent collaboration through A2A protocol
- Allows integration with MCP for accessing various data sources
- Facilitates development of complex fraud detection workflows

## Use Cases in Fraud Detection
- Building specialized agents for transaction analysis
- Creating agents for user behavior monitoring
- Developing investigation agents that can query graph databases
- Orchestrating multiple agents to collaborate on fraud detection
- Accessing and analyzing data from various sources through MCP integration
