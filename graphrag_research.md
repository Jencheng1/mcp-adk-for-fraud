# GraphRAG for Knowledge Retrieval in Fraud Investigation Research

## Overview
GraphRAG (Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an advanced approach that combines knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation to enhance fraud detection and investigation capabilities. It addresses the limitations of traditional RAG systems by incorporating the rich context and relationships available in graph databases.

## Key Features
- Leverages knowledge graphs to represent and connect information
- Captures relationships between entities, not just isolated data points
- Provides more accurate and relevant results by uncovering hidden connections
- Enhances explainability of fraud detection decisions
- Improves answer quality for complex, multi-hop questions

## Core Components for Fraud Detection
1. **Knowledge Graph**: Represents structured data with nodes (entities) and relationships
2. **Graph Querying**: Uses graph query languages like Cypher to retrieve relevant information
3. **Retrieval Mechanism**: Finds starting points in the network and follows relevant relationships
4. **Augmentation**: Combines retrieved graph context with user queries
5. **Generation**: Uses LLMs to produce accurate responses based on the graph context

## Implementation for Credit Card Fraud Detection
- **Entity Modeling**: Represents users, transactions, merchants, and devices as nodes
- **Relationship Mapping**: Creates connections between entities to show transaction patterns
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies suspicious patterns like:
  - Multiple accounts sharing device IDs or IP addresses
  - Unusual transaction sequences across related accounts
  - Circular money movements indicative of money laundering
  - Temporal patterns showing coordinated fraudulent activities

## Advantages Over Traditional RAG
- **Contextual Understanding**: Captures the relationships between data points, not just isolated facts
- **Multi-hop Reasoning**: Follows chains of relationships to answer complex fraud investigation questions
- **Explainability**: Provides transparent reasoning paths showing how conclusions were reached
- **Reduced Hallucinations**: Grounds LLM responses in factual graph data
- **Comprehensive Context**: Retrieves related information even when not directly mentioned in the query

## Integration with Other Technologies
- **Neo4j Integration**: Uses Neo4j as the knowledge graph database
- **MCP Compatibility**: Works with Model Context Protocol for AI agent interaction
- **A2A Support**: Enables agent-to-agent communication for collaborative fraud investigation
- **ADK Integration**: Compatible with Agent Development Kit for specialized fraud detection agents
- **Kafka Connection**: Processes real-time transaction data for immediate graph updates
- **PySpark Utilization**: Scales to handle large volumes of transaction data
- **GNN Enhancement**: Provides structured data for Graph Neural Network models
- **LangGraph Orchestration**: Supports workflow management for fraud investigation processes

## Use Cases in Credit Card Fraud Detection
- Identifying cashback fraud through multiple account creation
- Detecting identity theft by recognizing unusual patterns across accounts
- Uncovering fraud rings by mapping relationships between seemingly unrelated accounts
- Investigating transaction chains to trace the flow of fraudulent funds
- Supporting real-time fraud detection with contextual information retrieval
